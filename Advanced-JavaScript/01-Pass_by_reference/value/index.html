    <h1>Pass By Value</h1>
    <p>
        It means that JavaScript copies the values of the variables into the function arguments. Any changes that you
        make to the arguments inside the function do not reflect the passing variables outside of the function.

        primitive data types;(independent)(pass by value)
        numbers, string, boolean etc
    </p>
    <h1>Pass By reference</h1>
    <p>
        In Pass by Reference, a function is called by directly passing the reference/address of the variable as the
        argument. Changing the argument inside the function affects the variable passed from outside the function

        non-primitive data type;(dependent)(pass by reference)
        array, object
    </p>
    <script>
        // convert object value into a new array
       let obj1 = {
           fName: "abdullah",
           lName: "ansari",
           age: "19",
           rollNo: "007"
       }
       let arry1 = Object.values(obj1)
       console.log(arry1);
       // convert object keys into a new array
       let obj2 = {
           fName: "abdullah",
           lName: "ansari",
           age: "19",
           rollNo: "007"
